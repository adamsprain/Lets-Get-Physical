# Let's Get Physical
*An application by the Gym Bros (E_L1_01.1)*


## Application Overview
An application that supports active gym-goers to find partners to help them achieve their fitness goals. Inspired by the popular dating app [Tinder](tinder.com) but with an active twist.


## Visuals
With this project being in it's early stages, our best visualization is this high-quality Figma prototype created by Holly Qian.

## Technology
The team has recently (on 10/24/22) decided to switch technology stacks.
- ~~React(.js) + DjangoDB~~
- [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) Stack
    - MangoDB: a document database
    - Express(.js): a Node.js web framework
    - React(.js): a front-end JS framework
    - Node(.js): a JS web server
- [JEST](https://jestjs.io/): a JS Testing framework

A guide to the MERN stack can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial).


## Installation
A guide was made for the previous technology stack, due to the recent changes in technology, this will be completed once a more consistent process has been found.


## Usage
As this project is again still in it's early stages, therefore the application has limited usage. This section will be flushed out as the project progresses.


## Roadmap
There are currently four Epics that outline the primary user stories this project requires. Associated task can be found under the projects [**GitLab > Issues > Boards**](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs506/gym-bros-team/lets-get-physical/-/boards/)
